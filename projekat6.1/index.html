  <h2>Define what are you offering</h2>
  <div class="para">
    <p>Target specific area of your knowledge, and then offer your knowledge to clients.
      The main job of a freelancer is to find the solution for problem that your client gave.
      But firstly you need to write your bio, you need to choose carefull words that are easy to read,
      and that description is the main thing for selling your service. Every client firstly reads description
      and your reviews. Building of your profile is most important thing in freelancing jobs. 
    </p>
    <h2>Find your target audience</h2>
    <p>
      Now, when you have set your specific area of knowledge it is time to find clients, you can start 
      by defining what set of jobs are capable of doing. As a new freelancer you will have your ups and 
      downs, because you don't have reviews and feedback. But don't give up all you need is to give it time.
      Best advice is to make profiles on every freelancing platform, and document your projects so you can show
      them to potential clients. “I started my freelance business on Upwork in 2020 and found my first freelance client through Upwork’s platform. Over the last year, I have grown my business exclusively through Upwork and client referrals without paying for advertising or having to attend a networking event.”
      —Sean Cope.
    </p>
    <h2>Set your pricing</h2>
    <p>
      Set the prices of your services, you need to put your hourly rate, and put what you expect from client. From one time jobs to
      full time jobs is the range that you can choose your work. Pricing should be set depending on experience, industry, knowledge
      and other factors that are important for pricing. At begining of carrer you should not expect much, and you should set your
      payment rate low so you can find clients. After that your rating goes up, so you can make your prices bigger.
    </p>
     <h2>Final step</h2>
     <p>Now when you completed all of the steps above, you are ready to start working. It is possible that you would have some difficulties
       but after some time you will get in shape. I wish you luck in future plans of becoming freelancer.
